  - name: assert_total_amount_greater_than_average
    description: >
      Verifies that total_order_amount is always greater than or equal to average_order_value
      for each customer. This is a fundamental mathematical relationship that must hold true
      since average_order_value is calculated as total_order_amount divided by number of orders.

  - name: assert_average_order_value_positive
    description: >
      Ensures that average_order_value is always greater than zero. Since we're dealing with
      sales data, a customer's average order value should never be zero or negative.
